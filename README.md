#Senatorial

###Overview

**Senatorial** tells you what senators are talking about on the floor of the senate or in a committee meeting.  

The User puts in a couple of states, like CA and NV and a phrase like health. First it finds the four senators for those two states from one API. Then it uses another API to return the number of Congressional Records over the last few months that contain that phrase. All displayed in a line chart using D3 and C3!

This is a single page app that has a Rails backend on the first model and is using Backbone with all three Models.

Senatorial uses two external APIs:
GovTrak.us: https://www.govtrack.us/developers/api
Capitol Words: http://tryit.sunlightfoundation.com/capitolwords

Based on two states and phrase query selections by the user, data is pulled from the GobTrak API and subsequently passed to the Capital Words API.
